<!-- Web Development Tutorial for Beginners (#2) - How to build webpages with HTML & CSS -->
<!-- Taken and modified from the last tutorial-->
<!doctype html> <!--This tag is for every HTML page that just declares that the document type it HTML, esp. HTML 5-->
<!--tells browser we are working with an HTML5 page -->
<html>

	<head>
		<title>My Webpage</title>

		<!--Method #1 of Style here

		<style type = "text/css">
			body{
				background: red;
			}
		</style>

		Method #1 End-->

		<!--Method #2 of Style here -->

		<link href="main.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
		<!--IMOPORTANT: if your main.css file is in the same directory as your index.html file, then href = "main.css"
		You add "style/main.css" because it's a good idea to keep styles in their own directory. -->
		<!--Can also leave out type="text/css, some older browser might need that -->
		<!--Now add this link to each page and these pages will get the same styles as specified in main.css -->


		<!-- Method #2 End -->


	</head>

	<body>
		<h1>My Website</h1>
		<ul> <!-- unordered list that link to other content -->
			<li>Home</li>
			<li><a href="page2.html">page 2</a></li>
			<li><a href="page3.html">page 3</a></li>
		</ul>
		<h2>This is my homepage</h2>
		<p>And all of my homepage content</p>
	</body>	

</html>
		
<!-- However while this works and we can navigate between pages, there is no style. -->
<!-- now we're going to add style to the webpage -->
<!-- saved a file called main.css and what a CSS stylesheet is how we are going to styling -->
