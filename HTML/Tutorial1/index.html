Difference between Web Design and Web Development

Web Design: Graphic Design (Photoshop) Look and Feel of web page
Web Developmer: Cheaper, all you need is Notepad. But something better than notepad is Sublime Text

.html can be opened up in Chrome to tell it's a webpage

HTML = puts the content together on a page (but it's going to be ugly because it's just content)
CSS = puts together your style, Cascadeing Style Sheet.
JAVASCRIPT = Function, makes webpage do cool things. Makes things move around and animate. Fun, get paid better. easier to get remote flexible work.

HTML page: local host "Live Reload"
Core of HTML are tages. 

There are only about 10-20 tags
Tags next to each other like <head> and <body> are considered siblings

<!-- 3 Tags to create a web page -->

<html> <!-- opening tag --> <!--anything inside this is in my web page-->
	<head> <!-- not hat the use interacts with -->
		<title>My Webpage</title>
	</head>
	<body> <!--other tags go in here-->

		This is <strong>bold</strong> <br>
 		This is <em>italics</em> <!--"em" stands for emphasis-->
